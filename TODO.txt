TODO:
  - [FEATURE]
      Add option to manually set whether using stdcall or cdecl (easy fix)
  - [ROBUSTNESS]
      Calculate decorations for stdcall based on arg-byte-sizes, rather than
      brute-forcing up in jumps of 4 bytes.
  - [FIXME]
      Move codetype-specific option sanity-checks into plugin-file functions,
      then call those from define-ext.lsp
  - [FEATURE]
      Add test scripts.
  - [FIXME?]
      Check if possible to heuristically do a get_symbol on object code (for
      pre-compiled C, like .o files), and then fall back to just making the
      entry-point at the beginning of the code...?
  - [FEATURE]
      Decide if there is any valid reason to implement define-ext-macro (should
      be easy, just remove evals).
  - [FEATURE]
      Create installer in tools dir, to automate installation.
  - [PORTABILITY]
      Set the right default obj and asm code for different platforms (presently
      only sets x86 defaults).
