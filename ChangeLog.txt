	* Minor-Version bump (v0.2)

	* ChangeLog.txt, USAGE.txt, create-unix-docs.lsp, define-ext-settings.lsp: New files

	* define-ext.lsp: Replaced (letex) with persistant syms.

	* define-ext.lsp: Added checks for no options when code-type=obj

	* define-ext.lsp: Renamed plugin-list -> plugins, module-load-dir -> plugins-load-dir, plugin-combined-source -> buffer, ctype -> plugin, ctype-file -> plugin-file, plugin-load -> plugins-load, plugin-load-files -> plugins-to-load-files

	* define-ext.lsp: Replaced two instances of (extend [x] (list [y])) with (push [y] [x] -1).

	* define-ext_c.lsp, define-ext_asm.lsp, define-ext.lsp: (tcc_add_symbol) Added import command. Added invocation to enable callbacks. Added add-symbols-list option.

	* INSTALL.txt: Added info about creating *nix docs from Windows docs.

	* define-ext.lsp, define-ext_obj.lsp, define-ext_c.lsp, define-ext_asm.lsp: Renamed codetype-set-defaults -> codetype-set-default-code.

	* define-ext.lsp, define-ext_obj.lsp, define-ext_c.lsp, define-ext_asm.lsp: Created throw-error-full, fixed badly written throw-errors.

	* define-ext_c.lsp, define-ext_asm.lsp: (import_once), (set-cstring), (calloc) Created functions. Eliminated duplicated code.

	* define-ext_c.lsp, define-ext_asm.lsp, define-ext.lsp: (codetype-set-local-vars) Removed tcc_* from localising. Made them persistant across (define-ext) invocations.

	* define-ext_obj.lsp, define-ext_c.lsp, define-ext_asm.lsp, define-ext.lsp: Set "func" as a string instead of sym (to avoid 'MAIN:func confusion). Used (sym func) where necessary.

	* define-ext_asm.lsp: Added documentation for (1) code change needed if rewriting to use an assembler rather than asm() in C, (2) advice about using C for extended asm.

	* define-ext.lsp: Changed to save all syms under 'define-ext context (command is default functor).
