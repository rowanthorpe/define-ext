1)
Copy define-ext.lsp to wherever you want to load it from (if you are not sure
then the:
 (append (env "NEWLISPDIR") "/modules")
directory is a sensible choice.

2)
Copy the plugin files e.g. "define-ext_[CODE-TYPE].lsp" into either the
module-load directory specified near the top of "define-ext.lsp" (clearly
marked, for editing) or into:
 (append (env "NEWLISPDIR") "/modules")
as default.

3)
To (re)create docs with unix EOLs from docs with Windows EOLs, using newLISP:
 (change-dir "[define-ext_base_directory]/src")
 (load "../tools/create-unix-docs.lsp)
